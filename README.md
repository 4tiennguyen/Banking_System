# Banking_System
As digital financial services become important, the need for secure, efficient, and reliable banking systems also increases. This report discusses the design, implementation, and optimization of a banking system. The system addresses issues in transaction processing, and concurrency control, ensuring the integrity and reliability of financial operations. We explore schema design, transaction management strategies, and the execution of banking features such as deposit, withdraw, and transfer. In terms of database management, we carry out performance evaluations, comparing the runtime of various SQL query plans and assessing the effect of isolation levels on transaction concurrency. Our report contributes valuable insights to the ongoing discussion on optimizing banking systems for efficiency, security, and user experience.
